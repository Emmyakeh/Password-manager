# Overview

I developed a password manager program in Rust to further my learning and demonstrate proficiency in the language. This program allows users to securely store and retrieve passwords while exploring Rust's syntax and features.

The purpose of writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with Rust, a modern and powerful systems programming language known for its safety, concurrency, and performance. By building a password manager, I aimed to understand Rust's concepts such as ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, and to practice writing safe and efficient code.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the following tools:

- Rust programming language
- Visual Studio Code (IDE)
- rpassword crate for securely reading passwords
- Standard Rust libraries


# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found the following websites helpful:

- [Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
- [Crates.io](https://crates.io/) 

# Future Work

- Implement encryption for storing passwords securely.
- Add support for storing additional information such as usernames and URLs.
- Enhance the user interface with a graphical interface.
- Implement password generation functionality to generate strong passwords.
